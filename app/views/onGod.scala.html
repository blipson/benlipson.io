            Introduction
        </h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Every belief, and every non-belief, needs an argument or rationale. Of this I’m sure. The fundamental
            first step towards living a fulfilling life begins with thought, contemplation, and agonizing. This view itself then
            requires some backing, according to its own rules. The obvious argument for making arguments states that to
            relinquish reasoning is to submit yourself to an ideological abyss. In other words, if you don’t arbitrate your
            decisions anything and everything is permissible, and subsequently nothing is because we’re beings who perceive time
            as linear thus making an infinite number of possible actions effectively indistinguishable from no action at all. To
            make the rational movement towards judgment and decisiveness requires thought. Even to get to the point where we
            decide to be more decisive requires thought. Our consciousness intertwines itself with cognition intimately enough
            such that thought is the necessary groundwork on which all human adjudication exists. There are biological arguments
            to support this claim as well, but I’m not nearly comfortable enough in that arena to expose them. Suffice to say, a
            belief without reasoning behind it isn’t a belief worth having. This idea necessitates revisiting your beliefs,
            reevaluating your values, and rethinking your thoughts regularly. How can you say you still believe a belief that
            you’ve reasoned about if you have, or your environment has, substantially changed since the last time you reasoned
            about it? It could’ve been that you just thought your reasoning was sufficient because of the situation you were in,
            and now that the situation has changed the arguments you’ve made in the past no longer hold up.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Which brings me to the topic of this post. It’s been a hot minute since me and god, or gods(?) or
            non-god(?), have had a little chat. So I decided to have a good old fashioned heart to heart with
            her/him/they/it/nothing. It’s ended up being an extravagant ongoing conversation that’s so far taken a good number
            of weeks, perhaps even months (dare I say years?). I want to share that journey and take this post through it in the
            same chronological order that I’ve been going through it in. But before that, a disclaimer. Some of the conclusions
            reached in this discussion may seem intuitive. So intuitive, in fact, that you may end up wondering to yourself why
            the dialect was necessary at all when you could reach the conclusion purely from intuition. I want to stress again
            the importance of agonizing. When it comes to belief the journey is so much more important than the destination. A
            belief, even if it might make a point that’s easily defensible, is nothing without having actually made that
            defense. It amounts to a simple stab in the dark, no better than sheer ignorance and unwillingness to think and
            learn. So if you’ve found yourself coming to conclusions about god, or anything for that matter but specifically
            about god, without fully thinking through them (especially since it’s never possible to fully think through
            something, whatever that means), I strongly encourage you to give them another look, even if they’re the same
            conclusions I come to. You need to forge your own path, don’t take anything on faith (unless that’s where your
            deliberation leads you, which we’ll get to). I can only hope that this post inspires you to think. Anyway, with all
            that being said, and without further ado, I’ll now bring you actual substantive writing.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What is god?
        </h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Before we can make arguments for and against a thing we have to know what that thing is. Lots of
            different people mean lots of different things when they say the word “god”. The term is so vast that I hardly know
            where to begin. So I’ll do what I always do when I don’t know what to do which is to start with the easiest thing I
            can find and work my way from there. In this instance, the simplest starting point for me is the judeo-christian
            idea of god. Largely because that’s the culture in which I was raised. But even that has its different accounts. No
            one can quite agree on the attributes of the judeo-christian god. Within the category, the simplest sub-category for
            me is the well-defined concept of god that was thought up by St. Augustine and St. Aquinas in the 13th century.
            According to them, god must be omniscient, that is all-knowing. God must be omnipotent, or all powerful. God must be
            omnibenevolent, or possessing of perfect moral goodness. God must be omnitemporal and omnipresent, or existing at
            all times in all places at once. This definition is ridiculous, laughable even. For starters, none of this was ever
            in the bible at all, it basically amounts to medieval fan fiction. In fact in the bible god does a whole lot of
            things that would seem to directly contradict these attributes. That aside, the definition has some horrendously
            obvious logical inconsistencies in and of itself.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I have a hard time grappling with omniscience, because it means that free will doesn’t exist. If god
            knows everything then he (and I say “he” because the traditional judeo-christian god we’re currently talking about
            is a man) knows all that will happen at all points in time (this relates to omnitemporality and omnipresence as
            well). Knowledge and causation in this case are the same thing because he’s inherently infallible, so it’d be
            impossible to prove him wrong. Some classical liberals might make an argument from the perspective of
            omnibenevolence by saying that god gave us liberty, which is the highest moral thing he can imbue. But we’re not
            talking about omnibenevolence yet (we’ll get there), we’re talking about omniscience. If we have free will, god
            doesn’t know everything, and if god knows everything, we can’t have free will. Simple as that. I admit that it’s
            possible that we don’t have free will (which goes against the idea of liberal benevolence), everything could be left
            to fate. But what then of the modern idea of god or our relationship to him? It’s pretty difficult to have a
            personal relationship with someone who knows everything that will ever happen to you. It makes attempts at
            communication and prayer meaningless. Why ask for something when everything’s written in stone anyway? So the
            natural conclusion with god being omniscient is that we shouldn’t go to church, or waste time worshipping god,
            because there’s no way we’re going to get anything out of it from him. There’s an argument to be made about the
            benefits of the traditions by themselves, regardless of god’s contact or even his existence. But I know this isn’t
            what’s meant by going to church by a large majority of people, especially members of the clergy. It seems like
            either god isn’t omniscient, or we have to fundamentally restructure all of the institutions of western religion. I
            have a feeling that the authorities of the church would rather roll back on the claim that god is all-knowing.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Similarly, omnipotence as a concept is absurd and easily the most logically inconsistent of the traditional
            attributes. Imagine if you were to ask god to create something that he can’t influence in any way. His inability to
            create such a thing would mean that there’s at least one thing he can’t do, but his ability to create such a thing
            would also mean there’s at least one thing he can’t do, which is influence the thing. Either way, there’s no way god
            can do everything. That’s really all it takes to debunk that one, it’s a simple paradox.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The argument against omnibenevolence stems outward from the argument against omnipotence. An all-powerful god should
            be able to do evil, to sin. But an all-good god wouldn’t be able to do such things. Yet humans can sin. Why can I do
            something that god can’t? Even without omnipotence that seems weird, god should at least be more powerful than I am.
            Not to mention the classic problem of evil as a result of god. We’ll dig a lot more into this later on, but god
            seems to allow a lot of really shitty things to happen, so it’s very difficult to defend the position that he’s
            omnibenevolent, even more so if you think he’s omnipotent as well.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;It’s obvious to me that the traditional definitions of the judeo-christian god simply don’t hold up. The only
            logical thing for religious people to do would be to alter their idea of god, which many of them have. Reformative
            sects of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism have become much more popular as a way of compromising god’s divine
            attributes to maintain some semblance of logical consistency. People will admit that the god of the bible has a hard
            time making things happen sometimes, or that he often makes mistakes, or that he seems to do things that are
            considered evil according to his own laws, or that he misses out on certain things despite being omnipresent and
            omnitemporal. At any given time and in any given situation they’ll step backwards on one or more of the attributes
            to satisfy themselves and then stop thinking after that. While it’s admirable that they got far enough to begin
            questioning their beliefs, I’d like to go even further.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;A number of people in my personal life have gladly given me everything I’ve said thus far but still believe in some
            higher power or some god. This thing, whatever it is for them personally, must, as we’ve just discussed, look
            nothing like the traditional judeo-christian god. But it still could be the case that something higher than us
            exists. Something that isn’t omni-anything, but is just more powerful or knowledgeable or good than we are. This may
            exist in the form of some physical force or dimension like time or gravity. It may be a single god or a number of
            gods. It may just be a very powerful inanimate object floating around outside our universe. We’ll now continue our
            discussion under the assumption that god is not omnipotent, omniscient, or omnibenevolent, and that god may or may
            not be omnipresent and omnitemporal, and present arguments for and against the existence of that person/group of
            people/thing.

            Arguments for God
        </h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I devote this section to discussing the arguments and subsequent series of dialectical counter arguments for the
            existence of the altered version of god. The section contains all the arguments that I could think of to support
            god. I found some of them through research, others through people I know arguing for their beliefs, and others from
            my own contemplation. I present them in an order from the easiest to argue against to the most difficult to argue
            against, at least from my perspective.
        </p>
        #1.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A. You were raised a religion.
            </li>
            <li>
                (∴) B. That religion’s teachings must be true.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;A lot of people like to say that they go to church because that’s just how they were raised and they never really
            thought past that. Needless to say I find this line of thinking (or rather non-thinking) insufficient. If how you
            were raised affected religious truth in any way, then every religion that’s ever had someone raised in their
            tradition would be true. Therefore none of them would be true because they all directly contradict each other. Jesus
            and Muhammad can’t both be the massiah, and a massiah can’t both exist and not exist. Polytheism can’t be true at
            the same time as monotheism. The list goes on and on. Since the conclusion of this argument presents many logical
            inconsistencies we understand that the premise doesn’t necessarily lead to the conclusion, making this argument
            invalid.
        </p>
        #2.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A. The sacred text (i.e. the bible, torah, or quran) of a religion says to believe in the teachings of that
                religion.
            </li>
            <li>
                (∴) B. That religion’s teachings must be true.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The typical bible-thumping alt-right argument for belief. “It says so in the bible!” Ignoring the fact that most
            religious texts, and specifically the bible, say a lot of really terrible things, this argument is a simple fallacy.
            It’s begging the question. You can’t assume the truth of the conclusion of your argument in one of the premises of
            your argument. You can’t use the contents of a book to prove the truth of the contents of that book.
        </p>
        #3.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A. God’s so far beyond our comprehension that we can’t possibly reason about her/him/they/it.
            </li>
            <li>
                (∴) B. All counterarguments to god are thus unsound and god must exist.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;This one usually comes from religious people after they’ve had to confront a counter argument to one of their other
            arguments in this list. After being backed into a corner they sort of pull this one out as a way of attempting to
            save themselves. The counter argument is obvious. You can use this exact same logic to say that all arguments for
            god are also unsound because we can’t comprehend her/him/they/it. The burden of proof lies with the person positting
            the claim.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                A. God is “that which no greater can be conceived” - Anselm of Canterbury.
            </li>
            <li>
                B. There are only two ways in which something can exist, either entirely in our minds but not in reality, or in
                our minds and also in reality.
            </li>
            <li>
                C. Any good thing would be better if it existed in our reality as well as in our minds.
            </li>
            <li>
                (∴) D. God must be real, because if she/he/they/it wasn’t, she/he/they/it wouldn’t be the greatest thing we can
                conceive.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The traditional ontological argument first brought to prominence by Anselm of Canterbury in the late 11th century.
            This argument takes many forms. In modern times it’s often presented by saying something like “Don’t you believe
            there has to be something bigger than all of this?”. Basically the wistful feeling that people get when they stare
            at the stars at night and think to themselves about how small they are and about how something more powerful must
            necessarily be out there pulling the strings. I’m all for aesthetic appreciation, don’t get me wrong. The only
            problem is that using that as an argument for the existence of god is essentially a more complicated version of the
            same problem we ran into with argument #2. This too begs the question. Existence can’t be a predicate for an
            argument about existence. The first premise, premise A, assumes the truth of the conclusion of the argument, that
            god exists, and thus is unsound as a predicate. If god were to exist she/he/they/it would necessarily be that which
            no greater can be conceived perhaps, but there’s nothing stating she/he/they/it does exist. Guanilo of Marmoutiers
            expressed this counter-argument particularly well when he wrote a letter to Anselm in response to his claim. The
            letter stated that you can run this line of thinking to prove anything you want. In other words, imagine the best
            island you can think of. Nay, the greatest island that could possibly be conceived. It has mountains, deserts,
            forests, and all kinds of other really awesome stuff. This island must exist right? Because if it didn’t it wouldn’t
            be the best island we can think of. You see the logical flaw here, the island doesn’t really exist.
        </p>
        #5.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A. Things are contingent upon other things.
            </li>
            <li>
                B. Contingent things cause other contingent things creating a chain of causality.
            </li>
            <li>
                C. An infinite regress of contingency is impossible.
            </li>
            <li>
                D. (∴) There must be at least one necessary thing, and that thing is god.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;This argument also takes many modern forms. In my life I’ve most often heard it phrased as “we must’ve come from
            something, we couldn’t have possibly come from nothing” or the less eloquent, but more scientifically appealing
            perhaps, “something must’ve set off the big bang”. I want to first mention that this argument is the main reason
            that I’ve been using “she/he/they/it” to refer to god during this section, because it tries to prove the existence
            of god, but not any particular god. For all we know a giant rock could’ve set off the chain of consistency. Which
            makes it ironic that this argument was first brought to light by St. Aquinas in the 13th century, the same St.
            Aquinas who developed the traditional definition of god that we debunked earlier. It’s commonly referred to as one
            of Aquinas’ cosmological arguments. He has two others that refer to a similar principle called the argument from
            motion and the argument from causation. They state that god is the unmoved mover and the uncaused causer
            respectively using the same logic. A final cosmological argument he made was the argument from degrees about the
            benevolence of god, which states that god is a necessary perfect being because we must have something to measure
            degrees of goodness off of. He was clearly grasping for anything resembling a logical argument since he was willing
            to forfeit his own definition to try to create one. But let’s just take it as a given that he can sacrifice the
            divine attributes, as we have in this entire section thus far. This argument still doesn’t hold up. The third
            premise, premise C, is unsound. There’s nothing showing why an infinite regress is impossible. In fact, based on our
            current understanding of time, relativity, and metaphysics, it would seem that an infinite regress isn’t just
            possible, but it’s actually probable. This means that the universe definitely could have, and probably did, come
            from nothing. But an even stronger counter argument than showing the falseness of premise C lies in the fact that
            this argument is self-defeating. If premise A is true and things are contingent on other things, then what makes god
            the one exempt thing? She/he/they/it is still a thing, just like any other thing. If we’re to accept that there are
            exceptions to the rule that premise A posits, then who’s to say nothing else is exempt? And if anything and
            everything can be exempt then we don’t need to establish god specifically anyway, since an infinite regress would
            then not be necessary.

            <li>
                A. Reason won’t give us an answer to the god problem. You must choose between theism, a belief in god, or
                atheism, a disbelief in god. Any form of disbelief in god, including modern agnosticism falls under the category
                of atheism.
            </li>
            <li>
                B. There are four possibilities, each with their own ending. Theism results in either nothing or eternity in
                heaven. Atheism results in either nothing or eternity in hell.
            </li>
            <li>
                (∴) C. We should be theists because it’s the lowest risk and highest reward option. If we do this in
                self-interest for long enough it’ll grow into honest conviction.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Colloquially referred to as “Pascal’s wager” because it was thought up by Blaise Pascal, the 17th century
            mathematician and theologian. Despite his mathematical prowess, Pascal didn’t come up with a very convincing
            argument. The reasoning for the conclusion isn’t correct, it leaves out a very important premise. The option of
            believing in god is actually quite high risk as well, depending on how you believe. It costs you time, money, and
            the opportunity to live your life the way you want to live it. Theists argue that they have better lives because
            having belief has inherent benefits that have nothing to do with the actual existence of god, which is difficult to
            argue against. Who am I to say that their traditions aren’t meaningful? I’ve certainly been moved by them in the
            past. But I personally would rather be doing other things a lot of the time, and missing out on those things is a
            pretty severe bummer. Granted, it’s not nearly as much of a bummer as eternity in hell would be, so it’s still
            arguably less risk. But you need more than just “fake it until you make it” theology, and for those who can’t
            believe even if they wanted to whether or not believing gives inherent benefits is irrelevant. Besides, is fear
            really the correct way to guide religious decisions? There’s the apparent risk I already mentioned, but there’s a
            much larger risk of losing one’s own character by not being bold enough to believe what one decides is closest to
            the truth. Courage is important towards living a good life, and without it a good life may not even be possible.
            I’ll take a potential shitty afterlife over a guaranteed shitty real life any day.

                A. A human experience of objective morality is observed.

                (∴) C. God must exist.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;This one is known as “Kant’s argument from morality” or just “the moral argument”. It was first brought to
            prominence by the 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant, hence the name. I’ve found this one to be pretty
            popular in modern times as well, but it comes in the more condescending form of “if you don’t believe in religion,
            then where do you get your morals from?”. Indeed without some source it’d seem that our moral decisions are fairly
            arbitrary, but I’d argue that they’re arbitrary regardless. The first problem with this argument lies within that
            idea. Premise A isn’t sound. It states that objective morality is a human experience, but the fact that it’s a human
            experience means that by definition it can’t be objective, since the human experience is different for each person.
            If something is observed by a subject then it must be subjective and not objective. Arguing that an objective thing
            exists because it’s perceived by a subject doesn’t logically follow. Even if it did, there’s no proof to say that
            the most likely cause of the supposed existence of objective morality is god, so premise B is also unsound. Even if
            you were to try to make an abductive reasoning about it, there’s a sample size of only one, and thus it can’t have
            associated probability. Suffice to say if both premises are unsound we can conclude that the argument is invalid and
            move on.

                (∴) C. Someone or something designed humans (and everything) to serve these functions, and that person or thing

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;This argument was also originally brought up by St. Aquinas, but was later expanded upon and made famous by the 18th
            century utilitarian philosopher William Paley. It’s colloquially known as “the teleological argument”, or
            “intelligent design”. In his book Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity,
            William Paley presents an argument for god’s existence by analogy to show that a design implies a designer. Imagine
            you’re walking around and you find a watch lying on the sidewalk. You pick it up. It’s still fully functional. You
            notice that the back has been removed and you can see the mechanisms inside. Gears and springs working with each
            other in perfect harmony to keep the time. You wouldn’t just assume that the watch came from nothing. You’d make the
            logical assumption that someone must’ve intentionally made the watch. It makes so much sense and serves its function
            so well. Likewise, humans, and indeed all life, are clearly very intricate machines. We do things that are so
            extraordinary that we must’ve been designed. The counterargument negates this analogy and creates an argument by
            disanalogy by showing that our situation is fundamentally different from the watch’s. We don’t understand the design
            of ourselves like we do a watch. We can’t see all the springs and gears and mechanisms of life because we haven’t
            progressed far enough to unlock those mysteries yet. This counterargument is fairly easily disputed by pointing out
            the obvious fact that we don’t need to understand how something works in order to understand that it was designed.
            To use another analogy, it’s like the motherboard inside a computer. I don’t know about you, but I have no idea how
            all the transistors and stuff work on there. I have some high level knowledge, but I’ve never done any electrical
            engineering. Yet I can still tell it was clearly designed by someone. However the more fundamental attribute that
            makes the situation of a watch or a motherboard different from that of a living being is the idea of purpose. The
            only thing that truly implies design is purpose. The watch is meant to keep time, and the motherboard is meant to
            allow for all of the different pieces of hardware inside a computer to communicate with one another via electrical
            signals. What are we as humans meant to do? No one knows, everyone has their own belief. The most easily defensible
            position to me is that we simply don’t have a purpose. There is no universal meaning to our existence. Subsequently
            we get to create our own purpose for our own lives. That autonomy means that in a way we design ourselves. So we
            don’t need god under the definition of intelligent design because we are gods.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;But what about all our biological mechanisms? Forgetting the purpose of our consciousness, it seems like we have
            parts of us that clearly have purpose. Our lungs are meant to take in oxygen and emit carbon dioxide, our heart is
            meant to pump blood through our body, etc… But the original premises of the argument of intelligent design don’t
            necessarily lead to the conclusion, thus making it an invalid argument. Why does the thing that designed us have to
            be god? There are other conclusions that, given our current biological understanding of ourselves, make more sense.
            These being natural selection and random mutation. The teleological argument was modified by Richard Swinburne in
            the mid 20th century to include an abductive reasoning. In other words, of all the possible conclusions, we should
            go with the one that’s most probable, which is god. But he presents no proof, unlike the theories surrounding
            natural selection and random mutation. Another modification of the teleological argument is that god set up the
            precise conditions for natural selection and random mutation to occur, rather than them coming about by accident.
            The 18th century Scottish liberal philosopher David Hume objected to this by stating that should a creator exist,
            she/he/they/it seems to make a lot of mistakes. Like cancer, or hurricanes. Lots of stuff just doesn’t make sense. A
            flawed world implies a flawed creator. And is it worth it to worship a creator flawed enough to mess things up that
            badly? I’d argue that it’s improbable she/he/they/it exists, but even if she/he/they/it did it wouldn’t be worth it
            anyway.

        </ul>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;To me this is the best argument that can be made in favor of god. If you’ve read the work of Soren Kierkegaard you
            know just how poetic and magical the leap to faith can be and what it can reveal about the human condition. It
            definitely pains me to think of removing that from my life. But at the end of the day, I’m trying to get at truth
            (whatever that means). No matter how beautiful and expressive the idea of faith can be, I just can’t surrender
            reason and take the leap to faith. At least not at this juncture. It’s just not who I am. Wanting something to be
            true doesn’t make it the case, and I have to look at reality. Not to mention that believing in something because
            it’s expedient has its risks. If we can leap to god we can leap to whatever we want, including views about god, like
            that he wants us to discriminate against a certain group of people for example. In fact many people do just that.
            Evidence and justification are all we have to adjudicate between beliefs, so if something has no evidence or
            justification, then I can’t believe in it. I’m sorry, Kierkegaard.

            Arguments Against God
        </h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I mentioned earlier that the onus of proof lies with the one making the claim. But at the very start of this post I
            said that every non-belief needs its own justification as well. Language is a funny thing. A belief in not god is
            different from not believing in god, but I (like Pascal) still call them the same thing, which is atheism. You might
            call some of them agnostic, but to me agnosticism is a subcategory of atheism, and I don’t like the term agnostic
            anyways. It’s too often used as a cop out so you don’t have to argue either side. I posit that claims against
            something existing should be subject to the same rigor as claims for something existing. Arguments against god are
            pretty few and far between to be honest. A lot of atheists assume that god doesn’t exist; they take it on faith.
            That being said there are a few salient ones that I either found, heard, or came up with that I’d like to go
            through. Just like the last section I’ll do it in order from easiest to argue against to hardest to argue against
            from my perspective.

            the logical inconsistency in the argument for god made in argument #9, which I already pointed out. But that’s all
            it does. It really only serves as a counter argument, not a foundational argument itself. It doesn’t disprove
            anything, but it suffices as a dialectical response I suppose. Kinda makes you sound like a huge jerk towards

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I told you we’d get to the problem of evil. I could try to sum up this problem in words, but I wouldn’t do it
            justice. I leave that to better writers, like Fyodor Dostoevsky. In his book The Brothers Karamazov the character of
            Ivan Fyodorovich Karamazov, the middlest brother, has a brilliant logical mind. He’s an amazing student who demands
            a rational explanation for all beliefs. He’s plagued with religious doubt and has many great monologues in the book.
            Here’s a few excerpts from Rebellion, a chapter which is renowned as being one of the most well-formulated arguments
            against the existence of god ever made. Warning, these passages are very graphic and deal with severe cases of
            trauma and suffering.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;“Besides, there is suffering and suffering; degrading, humiliating suffering such as humbles me—hunger, for
            instance—my benefactor will perhaps allow me; but when you come to higher suffering—for an idea, for instance— he
            will very rarely admit that, perhaps because my face strikes him as not at all what he fancies a man should have who
            suffers for an idea. And so he deprives me instantly of his favor, and not at all from badness of heart"...
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;"The innocent must not suffer for another's sins, and especially such innocents! You may be surprised at me,
            Alyosha, but I am awfully fond of children, too. And observe, cruel people, the violent, the rapacious, the
            Karamazovs are sometimes very fond of children. Children while they are quite little—up to seven, for instance—are
            so remote from grown-up people; they are different creatures, as it were, of a different species. I knew a criminal
            in prison who had, in the course of his career as a burglar, murdered whole families, including several children.
            But when he was in prison, he had a strange affection for them. He spent all his time at his window, watching the
            children playing in the prison yard. He trained one little boy to come up to his window and made great friends with
            him"...
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;“By the way, a Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow,” Ivan went on...“told me about the crimes committed by Turks and
            Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria through fear of a general rising of the Slavs. They burn villages, murder,
            outrage women and children, they nail their prisoners by the ears to the fences, leave them so till morning, and in
            the morning they hang them—all sorts of things you can't imagine. People talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but
            that's a great injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as a man, so artistically cruel.
            The tiger only tears and gnaws, that's all he can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he
            were able to do it. These Turks took a pleasure in torturing children, too; cutting the unborn child from the
            mother's womb, and tossing babies up in the air and catching them on the points of their bayonets before their
            mothers' eyes. Doing it before the mothers' eyes was what gave zest to the amusement. Here is another scene that I
            thought very interesting. Imagine a trembling mother with her baby in her arms, a circle of invading Turks around
            her. They've planned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh to make it laugh. They succeed, the baby laughs. At that
            moment a Turk points a pistol four inches from the baby's face. The baby laughs with glee, holds out its little
            hands to the pistol, and he pulls the trigger in the baby's face and blows out its brains. Artistic, wasn't it?"...
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;“But I've still better things about children. I've collected a great, great deal about Russian children, Alyosha.
            There was a little girl of five who was hated by her father and mother, ‘most worthy and respectable people, of good
            education and breeding.’ You see, I must repeat again, it is a peculiar characteristic of many people, this love of
            torturing children, and children only.”...
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;“This poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture by those cultivated parents. They beat her,
            thrashed her, kicked her for no reason till her body was one bruise. Then, they went to greater refinements of
            cruelty—shut her up all night in the cold and frost in a privy, and because she didn't ask to be taken up at night
            (as though a child of five sleeping its angelic, sound sleep could be trained to wake and ask), they smeared her
            face and filled her mouth with excrement, and it was her mother, her mother did this. And that mother could sleep,
            hearing the poor child's groans! Can you understand why a little creature, who can't even understand what's done to
            her, should beat her little aching heart with her tiny fist in the dark and the cold, and weep her meek unresentful
            tears to dear, kind God to protect her? Do you understand that, friend and brother, you pious and humble novice? Do
            you understand why this infamy must be and is permitted? Without it, I am told, man could not have existed on earth,
            for he could not have known good and evil. Why should he know that diabolical good and evil when it costs so much?
            Why, the whole world of knowledge is not worth that child's prayer to ‘dear, kind God’! I say nothing of the
            sufferings of grown-up people, they have eaten the apple, damn them, and the devil take them all! But these little
            ones! I am making you suffer, Alyosha, you are not yourself. I'll leave off if you like.”...
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;“But then there are the children, and what am I to do about them? That's a question I can't answer. For the
            hundredth time I repeat, there are numbers of questions, but I've only taken the children, because in their case
            what I mean is so unanswerably clear. Listen! If all must suffer to pay for the eternal harmony, what have children
            to do with it, tell me, please? It's beyond all comprehension why they should suffer, and why they should pay for
            the harmony”
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;This is by far the most powerful and compelling argument against god to me. But it still has it’s counterarguments,
            namely the theodicy that present free will as a defense of evil, which I mentioned earlier (told you we’d get to
            it). It states that allowing for free will maximizes the goodness in the world, even though it allows for some
            suffering. It’s so inherently good that it makes up for the evil. There’s a famous quote by the famous writer C.S.
            Lewis that succinctly presents this counterargument:
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;“God created things which had free will. That means creatures which can go wrong or right. Some people think they
            can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong, but I can't. If a thing is free to be
            good it's also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Why, then, did God give them free will?
            Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or
            joy worth having. A world of automata -of creatures that worked like machines- would hardly be worth creating. The
            happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and
            to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and a
            woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that they've got to be free.”
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;In response to this we again come back to David Hume, who you remember as the man that claimed that god made a lot
            of mistakes and flaws in the world like cancer, or hurricanes. Those all apply here as well because the free will
            defense only accounts for evil which is committed intentionally by humans. It gives no defense against natural evil,
            or suffering that’s brought about seemingly directly by god, whether through disease or natural disasters or
            whatever else. In the end of Rebellion Ivan proclaims that he actually does believe that god could exist, but that
            worshipping him is indefensible and rejects (or rebels against) him. Here’s that excerpt:
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;“I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, even if I were wrong. Besides, too
            high a price is asked for harmony; it's beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back
            my entrance ticket [to heaven], and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as possible. And that I
            am doing. It's not God that I don't accept, Alyosha, only I most respectfully return Him the ticket.”
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;A more pragmatic response here might be that you shouldn’t care if god is evil or not, and that it’s stupid to
            remove yourself from heaven on moral principles. But that sort of misses the point of whether or not an evil god is
            worth worshipping. To direct you back at the C.S. Lewis quote, the sentence “Because free will, though it makes evil
            possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having.” still stands as
            legitimate grounds for defense of god’s goodness. Perhaps goodness can’t exist without evil? And goodness is so,
            well, good that it’s worth the cost of evil? But this only explains why evil exists, and gives no credence to
            quantity. Surely only a small amount of evil is needed to show us what good is, so why doesn’t god stick to that
            bare minimum? All those children suffering that Ivan mentioned in Rebellion really feels like overkill. They don’t
            add much valuable than some other less severe negative contrast. And even if they did, it’d be difficult to show
            goodness that’s proportionate with some of the evils presented. The truth is I’ve never found a theodicy that’s
            satisfying to me, and I don’t think one exists. In my mind, god simply can’t be omni-benevolent. But we already went
            through why the omni- attributes are wrong, and we already conceded that we have to give them up. The big problem
            with giving up omnibenevolence though, like Ivan proclaimed, is that it makes god not worthy of our worship.

            The Nature and Perception of God
        </h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Okay so we’ve debunked the classic definition of god, we’ve gone through arguments for a modified perception of god,
            one that removes omni- attributes, and arguments against that slightly modified perception of god. In my view, the
            arguments against the existence of god have won out. They may not be 100% provable, but they’re more convincing and
            easily defensible than the arguments for the existence of god. So the question becomes “what now?”. Do we alter our
            definition of god even further until we’re satisfied, or do we give up on the premise altogether? In the past this
            is as far as I’ve always gotten. I’ve given up at this point and concluded that god probably doesn’t exist and
            called that the end of it. But I’m curious. I want to see what happens when we try to make god fit into a defensible
            position.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Let’s begin by stating the obvious, many of the omni- attributes need to be completely forgotten about. God is not
            omniscient, god is not omnipotent, and god is not omnibenevolent. Period. I’ve yet to see a true counterargument to
            omnipresence and omnitemporality, so those attributes can stay in. What does our omnipresent and omnitemporal god
            look like then?
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Enter Baruch (or Benedictus) Spinoza. In 1665, he finished writing his magnum opus, a philosophical treatise that
            presented a proof of the existence of god in geometrical order simply called Ethics. Before writing, Spinoza seems
            to have followed a similar train of thought that I have, because it’s already assumed that we must give up
            omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence at that start. In fact, Spinoza goes even farther and gives up god’s
            consciousness entirely. To sum it up succinctly, his mathematics-style proof claims that A) God is infinite,
            necessary, and without cause, B) God is the only necessary substance, so all others result from God, C) God has
            infinite modes, which induce the laws of physics and the natural world, including active and passive modes, D)
            Nature is an indivisible whole, outside of it there is nothing, and E) God is not anthropomorphic.
            John Toland, an Irish philosopher that shared many religious beliefs with Spinoza, was the first to coin the term
            “pantheist”. He also used the term “Spinozist” interchangeably with “pantheist”. Throughout history there have been
            many notable pantheists, all of whom were directly influenced by Spinoza’s works. They include Hegel, Beethoven,
            Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Leo Tolstoy, Nikola Tesla, Claude Debussy, Carl Jung, and Albert Einstein.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;After reading through Spinoza’s Ethics multiple times, and spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about it,
            I’ve come to the conclusion that, while there are problems with Spinoza’s “proof”, it’s the most likely solution to
            the problem of what exactly natural world is. It’s simultaneously consistent with modern empiricist science, most
            reasonable western religions, and even more eastern religions. I plan on reading the Tao Te Ching in the near future
            to get an eastern perspective on pantheism. It’s something that’s compatible with theism, spirituality, and
            religion, but it’s also compatible with atheism and non-belief. Truly it encompasses everything (hence pan-) and
            presents the only logical choice in my mind. So for now I’ll move forward as a pantheist with the Ethics as my
            bible, and a deeper understanding of and connection to nature as a means of finally achieving peace with my own
            spirituality. I now leave you with this quote.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;“A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences
            himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his
            consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for
            a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of
            compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.” - Albert Einstein
