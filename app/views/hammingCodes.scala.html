        <p>&emsp;&emsp;In the mid 1940s a man name richard hamming worked on an electromechanical relay machine
            called the Bell Model V. Back then, computing machines were a lot slower. The Bell Model V was
            measured in cycles per second. To give some perspective, a modern CPU might be around 3.5ghz,
            which is approximately 3,500,000,000 cycles per second. Workers like Richard Hamming had to feed
            their program input into the machine on punched paper tape which was 7/8 of an inch wide and
            had up to 6 holes per row. Each hole would represent a bit of data, either a 0 if it were punched
            through, or a 1 if it wasn't. It was required that the Bell Model V be given input 24/7. Hamming
            and his coworkers, not wanting to work on evenings and weekends, set up a machine to feed jobs
            into the computer automatically. However, when the Bell Model V hit an error in the input, it
            would make a loud noise and stop all work indefinitely until one of the operators came in and
            fixed it. As you can imagine, this became very frustrating for Richard Hamming. He said to himself
            "Darn it, if the machine can detect an error, why can't it locate the position of the error and
            correct it?". He went to work on the problem and developed increasingly complex and powerful error
            correction algorithms. After a few years, in 1950, he published what's referred to now as the
            'Hamming code', which is a set of error correction codes that can be encoded into the data itself.
            It was such a good idea, most systems that utilize ecc (error correcting code) memory still encode
            data with hamming codes today, including dynamic random access memory, or RAM as a shorthand.
            This prevents electrical or magnetic interference from corrupting data. Your computer at home
            is almost certainly utilizing Hamming codes!
        </p>
        <p>
            So how do Hamming codes actually work?
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine we have a 3 bit number representing a piece of data.
            We can represent this number as a cube where each bit represents an axis with each of the
            possibilities on one of the corners.
        </p>
        <pre>
            000---------001
            | \         | \
            | 100---------101
            |  |        |  |
            |  |        |  |
           010-|-------011 |
              \|          \|
              110---------111
        </pre>
        <p>
            Let's use the first two bits as data and the third bit as a parity bit.
            In this case, the parity would cause us to lose 4 data points,
            But it's worth it to be able to detect a single bit failure (which transforms
            an even count of 1's into an odd count of 1's). Let's mark all these odd numbers with a star.
        </p>
        <pre>
            000--------*001
            | \         | \
            |*100---------101
            |  |        |  |
            |  |        |  |
          *010-|-------011 |
              \|          \|
              110---------*111
        </pre>
        <p>
            Each odd (wrongly transmitted) is cornered by an even (correctly transmitted) number.
            so if we receive an odd number (like 100), we can be sure it's wrong. This is called 1 bit error detecting code.
            <br/><br/>
            Now let's remove another bit of data and use it for parity as well (leaving us with one bit of data and two bits of
            parity).
            Then 000 and 111 are both valid data representations, and all of the other possibilities aren't,
            leaving us with this cube.
        </p>
        <pre>
           000 --------*001
            | \         | \
            |*100--------*101
            |  |        |  |
            |  |        |  |
          *010-|------*011 |
              \|          \|
              *110--------111
        </pre>
        <p>
            If you receive a wrongly transmitted piece of data (like 100), that piece of data
            only has 1 valid neighbor (000 is valid while 110 and 101 are not). We can correct this piece of data to instead
            Transmit 000. This is called a 1 bit error correcting code. Note that a 1 bit error correcting code is also a
            2 bit error detection code. We can continue to increase the size of the data infinitely so long as we put the
            correct number
            of parity bits in.
            <br/><br/>
            To put it more generally, if you have n parity bits, you have an n bit error detecting code. if you have 2n bits,
            You have an n bit error correcting code. it goes up by powers of 2. Also you need to be sure the data is
            ordered such that the "valid" codes don't border one another.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's put this into pseudo code, the general algorithm is as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Calculate the length of the hamming code
        </p>
            This is done using this formula:
        <pre>2<sup>p</sup> ≥ m+p+1</pre>
        Where m = the number of bits in the data, and p = the number of parity bits needed. This can also be solved using
        the logarithmic notation of that same formula which is this;
        <pre>p ≥ log<sub>2</sub>(m+p+1).</pre>
        How do we code this? Well you notice the ≥ symbol is used rather than the = symbol. That means this formula
        isn't an equality, which implies an iterator. In other words, it introduces the aspect of "time" to the equation.
        All you have to do is count upwards by 1 until you reach the first value that satisfies the equation for a given input.
        For example, for the binary input 1101, we can start with p=0.
        <pre>(2<sup>0</sup> ≥ 4+0+1) = (1 ≥ 5)</pre>
        False, 1 is not greater than or equal to 5! so that's not the answer. Let's go up by 1 making p=1.
        <pre>(2<sup>1</sup> ≥ 4+1+1) = (2 ≥ 5)</pre>
        Not yet, p=2...
        <pre>(2<sup>2</sup> ≥ 4+2+1) = (4 ≥ 7)</pre>
        ...Nope, p=3...
        <pre>(2<sup>3</sup> ≥ 4+3+1) = (8 ≥ 8)</pre>
        Yes! We found the lowest integer for which the given formula succeeds. As such, the binary string "1101" will need
        to encode 3 bits of data in order to have a functional error correcting code, making the total length be 7.
        Here's the code representing what I just described:
    <pre>
final def getNumberOfParityBits(binaryInput: String, acc: Int = 0): Int = {
    if (scala.math.pow(2, acc) >= binaryInput.length + acc + 1) {
        acc
    } else {
        getNumberOfParityBits(binaryInput, acc + 1)
    }
}
    </pre>
    As for why that particular formula is used, I'll come back to it. In the meantime, refer to this table to see the pattern
        that this formula produces.

                    were needed (step
                    1).

                <p>
                    The bits that alter a parity bit are determined by the position of the parity bit. You'll have to know how
                    to do
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://web.math.princeton.edu/math_alive/i/Labi/BinAdd.html">Binary addition</a>
                    To understand this part. If it's in the 1st position, then it will start with the first bit and add 1 bit,
                    skip 1 bit, etc...
                    if it's in position 2, then it will start with the second bit and add 2 bits, skip 2
                    Bits, etc... Position 4 starts with the fourth bit and adds 4, skips 4, etc... And so
                    On and so forth. The x's will count as 0's. This is why we used that particular formula in step 1. Counting
                    by powers of 2 in a base 2 number system (binary) allows us to encode data as either even and correct (0) or
                    odd and incorrect (1). It all starts with the left hand side of that function that states 2<sup>p</sup>.
