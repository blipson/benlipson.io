            Using WITH and UNION to optimize SQL queries
        </h1>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I recently learned about this trick for optimizing certain SQL queries, so I thought I'd share it in a blog post.
            It applies specifically to any query in which you have to retrieve some data from a table via two different routes.
            What do I mean by routes? Well if we think of our database as a large graph, where the nodes are the tables and the
            edges are the foreign key relationships between them, then having a "route" to certain data is just a path between
            two nodes. So having two different routes to get at the data you want might look something like this:
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Normally this would be done using
            <code>JOIN</code> clauses. To imagine that let's create an example schema. Perhaps you work at a company which uses
            a SQL database to manage its orders. Whenever a customer places an order it gets recorded within a table called <code>orders</code>
            . In addition to tracking orders, perhaps your company wants to track which customers placed which orders by name. So we have another
            table called <code>customer</code>. Let's say that a group of customers can all place a single order together, and that one customer
            can place many orders. As such, there must be a many-to-many relationship with a table between them, which we'll call
            <code>customer_order</code>.
        </p>
        <pre style="display: flex">
            <code>
                CREATE TABLE orders(
                    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                );

                CREATE TABLE customer (
                    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                    name VARCHAR
                );

                CREATE TABLE customer_order (
                    customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                    order_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                    CONSTRAINT fk_customer FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customer(customer_id),
                    CONSTRAINT fk_order FOREIGN KEY(order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
                );
            </code>
            <img src="@controllers.routes.Assets.at("images/customer_to_order.png")" style="padding-left: 5%" alt="" />
        </pre>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Now let's say that you're designing a feature for your system in which you need to search for all the orders that a customer
            has placed, and that you need to be able to search by the customer's name. It's pretty easy to implement this.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                SELECT orders.order_id
                FROM orders
                JOIN customer_order ON orders.order_id = customer_order.order_id
                JOIN customer ON customer_order.customer_id = customer.customer_id
                WHERE customer.name = ?;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;That's all well and good. But now let's imagine that you want to start grouping customers. Yes customers sometimes
            place orders on their own as an individual, but sometimes they do it on behalf of a company. It might be interesting to track
            which company a customer belongs to, if they belong to any at all. So you add another table called <code>company</code> with
            a one-to-many relationship with customers, assuming each customer can only belong to one company. But here's the kicker...
            let's say when someone places an order they can choose to either do it as an individual customer, or do it on behalf of
            a company. If they choose the latter, then they don't have to supply any of their own individual customer information
            because all of that information is already stored when the company "registered" in our system and assigned a few
            "point of contact" customers to themselves ahead of time. This means that in order to continue accurately tracking which
            customers are associated with orders, we need to link the <code>company</code> and <code>order</code> tables. Like the
            relationship between customers and orders, this will also have a many-to-many relationship with an intermediary table called
            <code>company_order</code>. Let's see what our new schema looks like.</p>
        <pre style="display: flex">
            <code>
                CREATE TABLE orders(
                    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                );

                CREATE TABLE company (
                    company_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                )

                CREATE TABLE customer (
                    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
                    name VARCHAR,
                    company_id INTEGER,
                    CONSTRAINT fk_company FOREIGN KEY(company_id) REFERENCES company(company_id)
                );

                CREATE TABLE company_order (
                    company_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                    order_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                    CONSTRAINT fk_company FOREIGN KEY(company_id) REFERENCES company(company_id),
                    CONSTRAINT fk_order FOREIGN KEY(order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
                );

                CREATE TABLE customer_order (
                    customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                    order_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                    CONSTRAINT fk_customer FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customer(customer_id),
                    CONSTRAINT fk_order FOREIGN KEY(order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
                );
            </code>
            <img src="@controllers.routes.Assets.at("images/company_to_order.png")" style="padding-left: 5%" alt="" />
        </pre>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Going back to our feature, the query to retrieve all orders a customer has placed gets a little more complicated now. We
            need to account for the 2nd path where they may have placed it on behalf of a company.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                SELECT orders.order_id
                FROM orders
                JOIN customer_order ON orders.order_id = customer_order.order_id
                JOIN customer AS c1 ON customer_order.customer_id = customer.customer_id
                JOIN company_order ON orders.order_id = company_order.order_id
                JOIN company ON company_order.company_id = company.company_id
                JOIN customer AS c2 ON company.company_id = customer.company_id
                WHERE c1.name = ? OR c2.name = ?;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;That's a lot of JOINs, each of which has bad performance implications as we traverse the table. Not to mention, we actually
            have to traverse through the customer table twice! You notice that there's an alias each time, either c1 or c2. That's because
            if we didn't alias them, then in the WHERE clause the database would have no idea which instance of customer we're talking about. Are we
            talking about the customer table we joined on when customers ordered directly, or the customer table we joined on when customers
            ordered through companies? It'd throw an "ambiguous column name" error. c1 and c2 allow us to specify the two routes to the
            customer table with different aliases. This means they both have to be in the where clause if we want to make sure we're
            getting all orders associated with a given customer, because it's possible that customer could make orders both individually and
            as part of a company.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Alright so it's not the most efficient solution, but is it really that bad? Yes. Primarily because it doesn't scale. Let's say
            we added a third route through which customers could place orders, say on behalf of some entity that we want to track separately
                from companies, like a government of a foreign country. We'd then have a <code>government</code> table and a <code>government_orders</code> table and in our
            query we'd then traverse through the customer table 3 times. Our where clause would say <code>WHERE c1.name = ? OR c2.name = ? OR c3.name = ?"</code>.
            Now imagine we add 5 more routes to get to the customer table from the order table. Our query would be a massive mess of JOINs, we'd
            have to traverse the customer table N times, and our where clause would be utterly unreadable. Wouldn't it be great if we could
            just traverse customer once and search by the customer's name once?
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Let's flip this problem on its head by starting at the end. Instead of getting all the orders
            for a given customer, let's first get the given customer and then get all the orders for that customer. Step one, getting the
            customer, is easy.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                SELECT customer_id, company_id FROM customer WHERE customer.name = ?;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Ok great, now that we have the customer let's get all orders associated with that customer using the output of that first query.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                SELECT orders.order_id
                FROM orders
                JOIN customer_order ON orders.order_id = customer_order.order_id
                WHERE customer_order.customer_id = ?; -- the ? will be populated by the id returned from the previous query.
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;You may have noticed, but we can actually optimize this little query and remove the JOIN because both the orders table and the
            customer_order table have the field order_id. So instead of searching for the orders from the orders table, we can just use customer_order.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                SELECT customer_order.order_id
                FROM customer_order
                WHERE customer_order.customer_id = ?; -- the ? will be populated by the id returned from the previous query.
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Ok that's great. We've optimized the query to not have to JOIN with the customer or orders tables at all. However, we've split it out
            into two different queries, which means we'd have to write some logic in code to stitch them together. Logic that could break or cause
            bugs. Wouldn't it be nice if we could do both queries together? Enter the WITH clause!
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                WITH customer_query AS (SELECT customer_id, company_id FROM customer WHERE customer.name = ?)
                SELECT customer_order.order_id
                FROM customer_order
                JOIN customer_query ON customer_query.customer_id = customer_order.customer_id
                WHERE customer_order.customer_id = customer_query.customer_id;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;At first glance it may seem like we're still joining on the customer table. After all, we're doing a JOIN on the customer_id. But if
            you look closely you'll see that the JOIN actually happens on the output of the WITH clause, labeled as customer_query. This means that
            it's only joining on the specific subset of data that we got when we did the first query inside the WITH. Instead of having to traverse
            the entire customer table, it only needs to look at one row! Yes it's a JOIN, but a JOIN on a set of data with only one row barely has
            an effect on performance at all.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Awesome, but what about the other path through the data? With what we have now we can get all orders placed directly by a customer
            blazingly fast, but we still need to also get all the orders placed on behalf of a company. How can we possibly do that in the same query?
            Enter the UNION clause!
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                WITH customer_query AS (SELECT customer_id, company_id FROM customer WHERE customer.name = ?)
                SELECT customer_order.order_id
                FROM customer_order
                JOIN customer_query ON customer_query.customer_id = customer_order.customer_id
                WHERE customer_order.customer_id = customer_query.customer_id
                UNION
                SELECT company_order.order_id
                FROM company_order
                JOIN customer_query ON customer_query.company_id = company_order.company_id
                WHERE company_order.company_id = customer_query.company_id;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Note that we now JOIN on the same single-line subset of the customer table defined in our WITH clause as customer_query, but this time
            we're joining by the company_id. Also note that we did the same performance optimization to get the order_id from company_order rather
            than having to JOIN on the orders table. Ta-da! Now we have all the data we need, we didn't have to JOIN on orders or on the full customer
            table at all, and our query will scale as we add more and more paths through our database.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;That's all I've got for this post! I just thought it was a cool optimization, so I decided to share it. If you're wondering how I found
            out about this, I work as an engineer on the promotions team at Target. Any time there's a sale anywhere at Target, online or in store,
            my team facilitated that. There was a need for people to be able to search for all the promotions that affected a given item. The problem
            is that an item can be added in many distinct ways to an offer. It can be added directly by id by saying "this item is on this offer".
            It can be added through the department by saying "this item is in the menswear department and the menswear department is on this offer".
            It can be added through the brand by saying "this item is a part of the Levi's brand and the Levi's brand is on this offer". I won't bore
            you too much, but there's 6 or 7 different paths through the data, and some of them could be combined (I.E. "this item is a part of menswear
            and the Levi's brand and menswear belonging to the Levi's brand is part of this offer"). Suffice to say, doing a bunch of JOINs and having
            a bunch of ORs in my WHERE clause to check the same thing wasn't going to cut it performance-wise, so I was forced to research this solution.
